      <h3>Education and Career Start</h3>
      <p>After successfully completing my training as an IT specialist for application development in 2022, my
        professional journey began as an SAP Consultant and Developer. During my apprenticeship from 2019 to 2022, I
        acquired extensive knowledge in software development, particularly in application development. This solid
        foundation served as the springboard for my career in the SAP field.</p>

      <h3>Professional Career as an SAP Consultant / Developer</h3>
      <p>Since 2022, I have been deeply involved with SAP technologies and gained valuable experience through various
        projects. My role as an SAP Consultant and Developer includes the implementation and customization of SAP
        solutions, the optimization of business processes, and the development of tailored applications for diverse
        business requirements. Working in this dynamic environment has honed my skills in problem-solving, analyzing
        business needs, and implementing complex software solutions.</p>

      <h3>Transition to Web3.0 Development</h3>
      <p>With a strong personal interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, I decided to steer my career in
        a new, future-oriented direction: Web3.0 development. This exciting and innovative field offers numerous
        opportunities to help shape the future of the digital economy.</p>

      <h3>Personal Interest and Future Vision</h3>
      <p>My fascination with crypto and blockchain drives me to delve deeply into these technologies and explore their
        potentials. I am convinced that Web3.0 and its associated decentralized technologies will fundamentally change
        the way we interact with the internet. With my technical expertise and enthusiasm for blockchain, I aim to
        contribute to the development of this new digital era by creating innovative solutions that have a lasting
        impact on the economy and society.</p>

      <h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
      <p>By combining my experiences as an SAP Consultant and Developer with my interest in Web3.0 technologies, I
